### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you

I'm deeply passionate about artificial intelligence and have embarked on an exciting challenge: learning to develop AI solutions while enriching my existing skills in the tech industry.

Throughout my professional journey, I've gained expertise in project management, business strategy, customer satisfaction, and technical integration. I've had the opportunity to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to implement innovative solutions, solve complex problems, and ensure service quality.

However, I now feel the need to explore new horizons by immersing myself in the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. That's why I've committed to an intensive training program focused on AI development, with a strong emphasis on Python programming and machine learning techniques.

My goal is to merge my existing skills with this new expertise to create innovative and impactful AI solutions. I'm determined to explore the endless possibilities offered by this ever-evolving field and contribute to the advancement of technology.

Feel free to explore my projects on Github and reach out to me for any collaboration or mutual learning opportunities in the exciting field of artificial intelligence!
